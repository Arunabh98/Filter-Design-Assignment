# Filter Design Assignment
## EE 338 Digital Signal Processing, IIT Bombay

This assignment was about designing a bandstop and a bandpass filter using a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) as well as an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR).
The [report][1] contains the design procedure for designing an IIR filter based on the Butterworth and Chebyshev transfer 
functions and also the FIR filter for the same specifications. 
Finally, the MATLAB codes essentially draw the magnitude transfer function for all the four filters.
